# 🌿 Plant Reminder App

### 🍏 Apple Developer Academy — 9-Day Individual Challenge

This project was developed during the second challenge at the Apple Developer Academy — a 9-day solo challenge focused on transforming interface designs into a fully coded application.

## 🌱 Overview

Plant Reminder is a simple and calming app that helps users take care of their plants with love and consistency.
In just 9 days, I designed and coded this app entirely on my own — bringing a UI concept to life through SwiftUI.

## ✨ Features

* Add Unlimited Plants
  Create as many plant reminders as you like — each with its own name, room, light condition, and watering schedule.

* Smart Watering Notifications
  Receive reminders to water your plants so you never forget again.

* Edit & Delete Plants
  Update plant details anytime or remove ones you no longer need.

* Track Your Progress
  See your watering progress with a dynamic progress bar that updates as you tick off your watered plants.

* Celebrate Completion
  Once all your plants are watered, the app celebrates with an “All Done” page featuring a happy plant 🌸
